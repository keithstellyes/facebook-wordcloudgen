# facebook-wordcloudgen
Generates a wordcloud from a Facebook group that the user of the script is admin of. Most of this was written on the city bus, so I still need to fix and clean up. 

# Usage
Your user access token is stored in a text file called "accesskey"
and the groupid to scrape is stored in a text file, "groupid"

get\_groups\_and\_ids.py will get all groups the token has access to and 
prints their respective id's.
